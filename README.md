<h1>Loomi</h1>

Loomi is an app similar to social review platforms like GoodReads or LetterBoxd but is aimed specifically at parents who want to find media with certain positive values for their young children.

__This is an iOS app prototype designed for the Apple Foundation Program @ RMIT during the November 2025 cohort in which there was less than 4 days to code the prototype.
Only movies were used as the media example for the prototype.
The backend was hardcoded using a JSON file for the prototype.__
